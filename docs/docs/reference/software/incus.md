# Incus
[Incus](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/) is a virtual machine manager similar to Proxmox which is more widely known. It offers a modern user interface and support for both containers and full virtual machines. It also supports templates out of the box making it easy to set up virtual machines of many Linux distros or Windows Server.

Incus is the recommended Virtual Machine Manager if you want to add virtualisation capabilities to your Podinate server, or want to run Podinate virtually.
