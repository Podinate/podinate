# podinate
Podinate is a simple package manager and PaaS for Kubernetes. It helps manage resources using a simple HCL-like syntax.

## Features
- **Simple Deployment** - if you're just trying to deploy a basic app you've written, Podinate can get it running in just a few minutes.
- **Powered by Kubernetes** - Podinate is powered by the battle-tested Kubernetes in the background, ensuring scalability, reliability and compatibility. 
- **Gentle Learning Curve** - Podinate is designed to be familiar for anyone who's used to working with Docker. 

## Getting Started
To get started with Podinate, follow these simple steps:

1. **Installation** Install a Podinate cluster by following our [Quick Start Guide](https://docs.podinate.com/getting-started/quick-start/)
2. **Configure Your App** Podinate uses HCL to define Pods to deploy. There's no YAML templating with Podinate. 
3. **Deploy Anywhere** Podinate can then deploy your configuration anywhere Kubernetes can run (hint: that's anywhere). You can start with developing on your laptop, deploy to a simple cloud virtual machine, and scale to an entire EKS setup. 

## Installing
To install a dedicated Podinate cluster, we recommend following our [Quick Start Guide](https://docs.podinate.com/getting-started/quick-start/). If you want to install Podinate on your local machine to start developing it, check out [Contribute.md](Contribute.md).
