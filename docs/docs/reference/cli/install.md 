# Install

The Podinate CLI `install` command is used to install a package. 


## Install Custom Package

```bash
podinate install
```
If you run `podinate install` without any arguments, Podinate will first look for a `./podinate` folder in the current directory, and install it as a package. If there is none, Podinate will attempt to install all of the `.pod` files it finds in the current directory. 

## Install a Package
```bash
podinate install <package>
```
Podinate will attempt to install the given package. 

## Search for Packages
```bash
podinate search <query>
```
Podinate will search through the configured package repositories and list the results.
